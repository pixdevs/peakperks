# Security Policy

At **Pixelatives TechVentures**, we take security seriously and are committed to maintaining the integrity and safety of our projects. If you discover any vulnerabilities or potential security issues, we encourage you to report them to us so we can address them in a timely manner.
<br> To report a vulnerability, please reach out to us through one of the following channels:

- **Email**: [pixelaives@gmail.com](mailto:pixelaives@gmail.com)
- **LinkedIn**: [Pixelatives TechVentures](https://linkedin.com/company/pixelatives)
<br>

### Response Time and Updates

Once you submit a vulnerability report, you can expect the following:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report via email.
2. **Initial Assessment**: Our team will evaluate the reported issue and classify its severity. This usually takes about **3â€“5 business days**.
3. **Ongoing Updates**: We will keep you updated on the progress of the fix. You will receive updates at key milestones, such as:
   - Issue verification
   - ETA for a patch
   - Deployment of a fix
<br>

### What Happens Next?

If your reported vulnerability is accepted and is analysed/verified by the security team, we will:

- Prioritize its resolution based on severity
- Push an update or patch as soon as possible
- Notify you once the fix is deployed

If the vulnerability is **declined** (e.g., due to lack of a verifiable issue or does not meet our security standards), we will:

- Provide an explanation for why the report was declined
- Suggest any next steps, if applicable

<br> We appreciate your vigilance in helping us secure our projects and are grateful for your collaboration in making our systems more robust.
<br> Let us work together to keep the digital world secure!
